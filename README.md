⚙️ How It Works
User selects a stock (TSLA / AAPL / MSFT)
Data is fetched from Yahoo Finance
Feature engineering is applied:
Lag values
Moving averages
Volatility
Returns
Pre-trained ML model predicts next price
Dashboard visualizes:
Actual price trend
Moving averages
Volume
Prediction results
🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model uses engineered financial features:

Lag_1, Lag_2, Lag_3, Lag_5
MA_5, MA_10, MA_20
Volatility (Rolling Std)
Return (% change)
Volume

Trained using supervised regression models (stored as .pkl files).
